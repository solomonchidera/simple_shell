# Simple Shell Project.
## Project Objective:
- Create a prompt and wait for user to input a command.
- parse the command if it's more than 2 in the line.
- Tokenize long strings.
- search for the executable form of the command in the path.
- display the executable file as a baby process of the shell parent process.
- Go back to the parent process again which is your shell itself.
